## Independent Lab Testing Results

### Source: Narc Gone MX testing with Fentanyl and Ketamine (12.7.22)

### Testing Methodology

**Conducted by:** North Carolina State Crime Laboratory and forensic laboratory in Arlington, Texas

**Test Date:** August 29, 2022 (drugs placed in bottles)

**Drugs Tested:**
- 5.3 grams of Fentanyl (in 16-ounce Narc-Gone bottle)
- 6.91 grams of Ketamine (in 16-ounce Narc-Gone bottle)

### Fentanyl Destruction Results

**Initial concentration:** 27,890 PPM (parts per million)

**After 15 days (drugs in outer wrapping):**
- Concentration: 15 PPM
- **Reduction: 99.95%**

**After 31 days (outer wrapping removed):**
- Concentration: 4 PPM
- **Reduction: >99.99%**

### Key Differentiator

**GFMD is the ONLY company that has worked with certified forensic laboratories to prove the amount of reduction for various drugs**

This differentiates Narc Gone from other chemical drug disposal systems that do not provide quantitative testing results.

### Important Note

For effective drug destruction, all drugs must be removed from outer wrappings before placement in Narc Gone containers.
