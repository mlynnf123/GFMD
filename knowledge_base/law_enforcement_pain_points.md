# Law Enforcement Drug Disposal Pain Points & Challenges

## Source: KBIA News Investigation (June 2024)

### Real-World Case Study: Fayette Police Department

**Department Size:** 8 active duty + 7 reserve officers

**Problem:** No reliable way to dispose of drug evidence

**Result:** Drugs in evidence bags turned up in dumpster behind grocery store, causing public outcry

### Primary Pain Points

#### 1. Geographic Accessibility

**Challenge:** EPA-approved incinerators are often 100+ miles away from small/mid-sized departments

**Example:** In Missouri, only EPA-approved incinerators are more than 100 miles from Fayette

**Impact:** Requires multi-day trips, multiple officers, vehicle costs, time away from community

#### 2. Cost Barriers

**Incinerator Purchase Costs:**
- Drug Terminator unit: ~$6,000 after taxes and shipping
- Fayette PD couldn't afford it
- Failed to secure grant funding

**Incineration Service Costs:**
- Approximately $1.50 per pound
- Secure transportation costs
- Permanent medicine drop boxes: $700-$1,000 each

#### 3. Permit Restrictions

**Challenge:** Departments with incinerators often cannot share with other agencies

**Example:** Columbia PD's permit from Missouri Department of Natural Resources prohibits burning "obtained contraband or prohibited goods from other governmental agencies"

**Impact:** Even nearby departments cannot pool resources

#### 4. Evidence Room Storage Constraints

**Challenge:** Drug evidence takes up valuable property room space

**Impact:** 
- Longer storage times for drug take-back program items
- Reduced storage space for other evidence
- Backlog of drugs awaiting disposal

#### 5. Safety & Environmental Concerns

**Improper Disposal Methods (still happening):**
- Digging holes and burning drugs in open air
- Dumping in trash (Fayette incident)
- Flushing (historical method, now discouraged)

**Risks:**
- Hazardous smoke exposure
- Drug contamination of soil/waterways
- Public safety hazards
- Community trust issues

#### 6. Regulatory Compliance Burden

**DEA Requirements:**
- All drugs must be destroyed in EPA-approved incinerators
- Strict documentation and chain of custody
- Specific destruction standards (non-retrievable)

**EPA Requirements:**
- Environmental safety standards
- Emissions controls
- Permitted facilities only

### Current "Solutions" and Their Limitations

#### Incineration
**Pros:** EPA/DEA approved, complete destruction
**Cons:** Expensive, requires travel, limited access, permit restrictions

#### At-Home Disposal Products (Deterra, DisposeRx, RX Destroyer)
**Pros:** Convenient for consumer use
**Cons:** 
- Not FDA-approved
- Not widely known
- Not scalable for law enforcement bulk needs
- Designed for household, not evidence room volumes

#### Drug Take-Back Events
**Pros:** Community engagement
**Cons:** 
- Only twice per year
- Creates storage backlog between events
- Requires coordination and resources

### Expert Perspectives

**Jeff Horwitz, CEO of SAFE Project:**
> "I think the legislation really should require that if there are medications in the responsibility of your job.. that they need to have a secured destruction plan available."

**Jeremy Pretszch, Elastec Sales Manager:**
> "For years, the method for destroying narcotics and pharmaceuticals was to flush it. Since then, there's not really been a good solution for destroying them, but incineration is probably the best option as it is."

### The Gap in the Market

**What law enforcement needs:**
1. On-site, on-demand destruction capability
2. Affordable solution (not $6,000+ equipment)
3. No travel required
4. DEA/EPA compliant
5. Scalable for bulk evidence disposal
6. Simple to use (no special training)
7. Safe for environment and officers
